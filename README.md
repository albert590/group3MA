PROBLEM STATEMENT
 Problem Statement for Hostel Booking Application
Finding suitable student accommodation in Kenya is often difficult, time-consuming, and unreliable. Most students must walk from hostel to hostel asking for room availability, prices, and amenities. This process is inconvenient, especially during opening weeks when hostels fill up quickly. Students also struggle to compare hostels, and sometimes end up choosing rooms that are unsafe, overpriced, or far from school.
On the other hand, hostel owners depend on physical visits and word-of-mouth to advertise their rooms. This makes it hard for them to reach students, manage bookings, and update room availability efficiently.
Because of the lack of a central digital platform, both students and hostel owners face challenges such as misinformation, delays, overcrowding, and lost opportunities.
Therefore, there is a need for a mobile-based hostel booking application that allows students to easily search, compare, and book available hostels, while enabling hostel owners to manage listings and update availability in real time.
